<a name="projmo"/>

## Project Motivation
This is a Udacity project that is intended to test my abilities as a data scientist and how I would perform with a real world task, for that I chose to work with Starbuckse data, and answer the following questions:
1. For the completed offers, what is the distribution of offer types and channels?
2. What are the characteristics of customers who complete 50% or more of the offers they view and those who complete less?
3. Can we determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type?
